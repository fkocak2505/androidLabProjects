#Android Wear App Demo

This sample demonstrates how you can build any android application for Android Wear devices.
 
###What the application does?
This application counts the steps taken by the user as soon as the user start tracking. The steps count will be displayed on the watch display in an Always-On Activity. This activity also supports ambient mode for Android Wear.
Android Wear applications can't create without creating the android phone application. The application on the phone displays the steps count by the android wear watch and also the current status of step tracking. This is using messages and data map APIs to communicate with the watch.
 
###What will you learn:
- How to create an android wear application.
- How to communicate between phone and device using DataMap and Messaging APIs.
- How to create Always On Activity.
- Handling ambient mode on android wear.
- Reading sensors on android wear.
