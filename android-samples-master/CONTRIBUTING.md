#### Rules for the contribution:
- Make a sample app that is with full of informative comments. Those comments should help new developers to understand each line of code.
- Make read me file for the sample you created.That should contain an introduction *(must be descriptive)* of what your sample is for. Also, if you have some article/tutorial that can help new developers, put that link in the readme file. 
- Add you project name and sort description in [README.md](https://github.com/kevalpatel2106/android-samples/blob/master/README.md) present at the root of the repository.
- Your code must be created in Android Studio. *([Eclipse is now depricated](http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/02/google-officially-ends-support-for-eclipse-android-developer-tools-in-favor-of-android-studio/).)*
- Your code should not contain any auto generated file like `/build`, `/.gradle folder` or any `*.apk` files. You can use [this](https://gist.github.com/kevalpatel2106/ca6d1f1fd778af4d92162edf19045ad5) `.gitignore` file to eliminate those items.

Happy coding.:-)
